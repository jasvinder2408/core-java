Problem Description
You are given a n x n 2D matrix A representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You need to do this in place.

Note: If you end up using an additional array, you will only receive partial score.

To rotate a given n√ón 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in place, you can perform the following steps:

Approach:
Transpose the Matrix: The transpose of a matrix involves flipping the matrix over its main diagonal, swapping elements at A[i][j] with A[j][i].

Reverse Each Row: After transposing the matrix, the elements in each row are reversed to achieve a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

Time Complexity:
The overall time complexity is O(N^2) where N is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.

Space Complexity:

Since we are performing the rotation in place, the space complexity is O(1) (no extra space is used).

Steps:
=====
1) Transpose the matrix.
2) Reverse each row of the transposed matrix


Explanation:
===================
Given the matrix:

1  2  3
4  5  6
7  8  9

Step 1 (Transpose): Swap elements to get the transpose.

1  4  7
2  5  8
3  6  9

Step 2 (Reverse each row): Reverse each row to rotate the matrix by 90 degrees.

7  4  1
8  5  2
9  6  3
Thus, the matrix has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise in place.

Output:
=======

7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3

This approach meets the requirement of in-place rotation and avoids using additional arrays, ensuring an optimal solution with O(N^2) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
