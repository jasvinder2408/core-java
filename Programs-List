Beginner

->. Delete an element from an array. (ArrayDeletion_3.java).
->. Insert an element in an array.
->. For each array A, you have to find the value of absolute difference
   between the counts of even and odd elements in the array. (EvenOddDifference_9.java).

->. You are given an integer array A, you have to return an integer array of same size whose ith element is the frequency count of A[i] in array A .
    * Note:

    * When comparing two elements of the ArrayList(java), make sure to use .equals() method for accurate comparison.
    * Eg : To compare ith index with jth index use A.get(i).equals(A.get(j)).
